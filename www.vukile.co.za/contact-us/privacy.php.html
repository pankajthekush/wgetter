  <h2>Type of Information Collected</h2>
  <p>Every computer connected to the internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's
  "Internet Protocol" (IP) address. When a visitor requests a page from a web site, the web server may record that
  visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address
  from which you have accessed our site. We may use this information to examine traffic in aggregate.</p>
    <p>From time to time we may save a "cookie" on your computer. A
    cookie is a small text file sent from our web server that is saved on your
    hard drive via your internet browser. A cookie cannot read data from your
    computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. Cookies
    do not damage your system. We may use cookies to identify which areas of the
    site you have visited in order to monitor and improve our site or to improve
    your user experience of the site. You can choose whether to accept cookies
    by changing the settings of your internet browser. You can reset your
    browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a
    cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your
    experience of our site and other web sites may be diminished and some
    features may not work as intended.</p>
    <p>In order to fulfill certain services that can be requested through this
    site we may need your email address and possibly your postal address. This
    information, if provided by you, will remain confidential and will not be
    passed on to anyone outside of Vukile or ProfileData without your prior
    consent.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Data is held only as long as necessary. If you request that we send you a copy of a document, your details will be
    deleted or depersonalised once the information has been posted to you. If you ask to be emailed with data, news or
    announcements from Vukile, we will hold your details on our database until such time as you chose to unsubscribe from this
    service. You may do this at any stage by selecting the appropriate option in the Email Alerts section of this site.</p>
    <strong>
    <h2>Use and Disclosure</h2>
    </strong><p><strong></strong>We will only use or disclose your personal information for the purpose for which it was collected unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have consented to its further use or disclosure;</li>
      <li>you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose it in such a way; or</li>
      <li>we are required by law or are otherwise compelled to disclose such
        information.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>
    <h2>Quality and Security</h2>
    </strong><p><strong></strong>We make every effort to ensure the security of personal information we hold. We try to ensure that the personal
    information we collect, disclose and use is complete and accurate.</p>
    <strong>
    <h2>Access and Correction</h2>
    </strong><p><strong></strong>Please contact us by phone, fax or email if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-top: -15">require access to any personal information we
        hold on you;</p></li>
      <li>wish to notify us of any change, modification or correction; or</li>
      <li>would like to have your personal information removed from our records.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may require suitable proof of identity from you before we take action
    on the above requests.</p>
    
    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Vukile website you consent to the collection and use of information as specified above. If we change our
    privacy policy we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
    it, and the circumstances that may warrant disclosure.
